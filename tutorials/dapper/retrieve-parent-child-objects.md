# Retrieve Parent-Child Objects

So far, we have performed operations on a single row. But what if we need to deal with more complex objects that have parent-child relationships. Let's consider we have a simple database that contains the following tables.

As you can see that there is a one-to-many relationship between an `Author` and `Book` tables.  A single author can have many books. 

If you look at the `Author`, you can see a list of books. 

```csharp
class Author
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public List<Book> Books { get; set; }
}

class Book
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
}
```

In a database, you can see on the first row of `Authors` that **Cardinal Tom B. Erichsen** has an `Id = 1`.

If you look in the `Books` table, you can see that there are two different rows that have an `AuthorId` of 1. So **Cardinal Tom B. Erichsen** has written multiple books. 

So let's retrieve the authors from a database and their respective books using the `QueryMultiple` extension method. It can execute multiple queries within the same command and map results.

```csharp
private static void GetAuthorAndTheirBooks(int id)
{
    string sql = 
        "SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Id = @Id;" +
        "SELECT * FROM Books WHERE AuthorId = @Id;";

    using (IDbConnection db = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
    {
        using (var results = db.QueryMultiple(sql, new { Id = id}))
        {
            var author = results.Read<Author>().SingleOrDefault();
            var books = results.Read<Book>().ToList();

            if (author != null && books != null)
            {
                author.Books = books;

                Console.WriteLine(author.FirstName + " " + author.LastName);
                
                foreach (var book in author.Books)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("\t Title: {0} \t  Category: {1}",  book.Title, book.Category);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can see that first, we have specified two different `SELECT` statements, the first one for the individual author and the second one for the author's books. 

 - The `QueryMultiple` is an extension method that returns multiple result sets in the query results of type `GridReader`. 
 - Then we simply need to call the `Read` method on that object multiple times to get the author record and then for books. 

Let's call the `GetAuthorAndTheirBooks` method in the `Main` method.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    GetAuthorAndTheirBooks(1);
    GetAuthorAndTheirBooks(2);
}
```

Let's execute the above code, and you will see the following output.

```csharp
Cardinal Tom B. Erichsen
