# Getting Started

**Dapper.SimpleCRUD** is a small NuGet library that extends the `IDbConnection` interface, which adds the basic CRUD operations to **Dapper**. It adds some generic utility methods and particularly CRUD operations become much simpler with **Dapper.SimpleCRUD**.

 - It uses smart defaults without using attributes in your classes, but you can also override the defaults as per your requirements. 
 - By default, the `Id` property is used as a primary key, but you can use other properties as a primary key by specifying an attribute.
 - By default, the table name matches the class name, but you can use another table name by specifying an attribute.
 - Similarly, by default, the column name matches the property name, but you can use another column name by specifying an attribute.

The following is the list of extension methods that are provided in **Dapper.SimpleCRUD**.

| Method                | Description                                                 |
| :---------------------| :-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Get                   | Get a record based on the primary key                       |
| GetList               | Get a list of records from a table                          |
| GetListPaged          | Get a paged list of all records matching the conditions     |
| Insert                | Insert a record and returns the new primary key             |
| Update                | Update a record                                             |
| Delete                | Delete a record based on primary key or typed entity        |
| DeleteList            | Delete all records matching the conditions                  |
| RecordCount           | Get count of all records matching the conditions            |  

For projects targeting .NET 4.5 or later, you can also use the async versions of all the above methods.
