# Getting Started

## Naming Convention

Entity Framework Core generates the database schema from the model when you use migration or call the `context.Database.EnsureCreated()`. 

 - The name of generated objects has to be inferred from the name of the classes and properties. 
 - The default names should be ok for a lot of people, but sometimes you need to use a specific naming convention. 
 - For example, some developer wants the table name to be upper case or column names to be prefixed by the table name, etc.

**EFCore.NamingConventions** is a NuGet library for **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore** provides naming conventions for Entity Framework Core tables and columns.

## Supported Naming Conventions

**EFCore.NamingConventions** supports the following naming conventions.

 - UseSnakeCaseNamingConvention: FullName becomes `full_name`
 - UseLowerCaseNamingConvention: FullName becomes `fullname`
 - UseCamelCaseNamingConvention: FullName becomes `fullName`
 - UseUpperCaseNamingConvention: FullName becomes `FULLNAME`

## Installation

You can easily install it from the **Package Manager Console** window by running the following command.

```csharp
