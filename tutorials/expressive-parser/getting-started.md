 - Supports 32/64 bit, signed/unsigned, and hex integer literals.
 - Features a true conditional operator.
 - Supports short-circuited logical operations.
 - Supports arithmetic, comparison, implicit, and explicit overloaded operators.
 - Variables of any type can be dynamically defined and used in expressions.
