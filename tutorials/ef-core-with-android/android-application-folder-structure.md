# Android Application Folder Structure

In the following picture, we have the complete folder structure of a **Xamarin.Android** application. We will go through every folder and describe the contents of it, to get a bit more familiarized with the structure of a **Xamarin.Android** app.

Letâ€™s look at the items inside the Project to see each folder and its purpose.

## Properties

 - It contains the `AndroidManifest.xml` file that describes all the requirements for the **Xamarin.Android** application, including name, version number, and permissions. 
 - The **Properties** folder also contains `AssemblyInfo.cs`, a .NET assembly metadata file. It is a good practice to fill this file with some basic information about your application.

## References 

 - It contains the assemblies required to build and run the application. 
 - If you expand the **References** folder, you'll see references to .NET assemblies such as `System`, `System.Core`, and `System.Xml`, as well as a reference to Xamarin's **Mono.Android** assembly.

## Assets 

 - It contains the files the application needs to run including fonts, local data files, and text files. 
 - Files included here are accessible through the generated `Assets` class. 

## Resources 

 - It contains application resources such as strings, images, and layouts. 
 - You can access these resources in code through the generated `Resource` class. 

The **Resources** directory contains the following folders and a file name.

### drawable

 - The **drawable** directory contains the drawable resources such as images and bitmaps.

### mipmap 

 - The **mipmap** directory holds drawable files for different launcher icon densities. 
 - In the default template, the **drawable** directory contains the application icon file, i.e. `Icon.png`.

### layout

 - The **layout** directory contains Android designer files (`.axml`) that define the user interface for each screen or Activity. 
 - The template creates a default layout called `activity_main.axml`.

### values

 - The **values** directory contains XML files that store simple values such as strings, integers, and colors. 
 - The template creates a file to store string values called `Strings.xml`.

### Resource.designer.cs

 - It is also known as the `Resource` class; this file is a partial class that holds the unique IDs assigned to each resource. 
 - It is automatically created by the **Xamarin.Android** tools and is regenerated as necessary. 
 - This file should not be manually edited, as **Xamarin.Android** will overwrite any manual changes made to it.
